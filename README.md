# VITYARTHI-PROJECT

# Campus Event Manager

**Easily organize events and track who’s coming—with just Python!**

## What’s inside?
- Add campus events (date, price, seats—anything you want!)
- Register yourself (or friends) for any event
- View all events and see who registered
- Instantly see ticket revenue, seat filling, and event countdowns (thanks to NumPy, SymPy, and datetime)

## How do I run this?

1. **Check if Python 3 is installed**  
   Open terminal (search “cmd” in Windows) and type:  

   If it shows something like `Python 3.10.5` you’re good!

2. **Install the magic tools (one-time only):**  
   ```
   pip install numpy sympy
   ```

3. **Get the code**  
   Copy it and save the same.
   
4. **Open your folder in File Explorer**  
   Click the bar at the top, type `cmd`, hit Enter.

5. **Run your project:**  


6. **Use the menu!**  
   Just type a number, press Enter, and follow along.

## Why try this?
- No boring setup, no passwords. Open and use!
- See live stats (just like a real event boss)
- Code is super clear—you can play, change, or break it to learn
